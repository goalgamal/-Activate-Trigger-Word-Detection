# Activate Trigger Word Detection

This project implements a deep learning solution for detecting the trigger word **"activate"** in audio data. Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), the model processes audio input and predicts the presence of the trigger word with high accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Features
- Preprocessing of raw audio data to extract relevant features.
- Implementation of RNN-based deep learning models for sequential data analysis.
- Real-time trigger word detection with a focus on performance and accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Audio Processing Libraries**: Librosa
- **Others**: NumPy, Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Activate-Trigger-Word-Detection.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `Trigger_word_detection_v2a.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and test its performance.

## Results
- The model successfully detects the trigger word "activate" in audio inputs.
- Achieved high accuracy in both training and testing phases, suitable for deployment in real-time systems.

## File Structure
- `Trigger_word_detection_v2a.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the project implementation.
